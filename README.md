# alphaGAN_tensorflow
alphaGAN implementation in [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

original paper:Variational Approaches for Auto-Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04987)

reference codes:

use `python main.py` to run the model with MNIST dataset, or import your own dataset, or build new network structure

currently require [tensorlayer](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer)
